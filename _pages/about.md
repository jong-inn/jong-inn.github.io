### Hi there! üôå

I'm **Jong Inn Park** **(Î∞ïÏ¢ÖÏù∏)**, commonly known as **Jong** in the US. I work as a Research Engineer and Full Stack Web Developer at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), under the mentorship of [Prof. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) and [Prof. Richard N. Landers](https://rlanders.net/). I recently graduated from the [Data Science](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience) Master's program at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). During the program, I conducted research under the guidance of [Prof. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) in the [Minnesota NLP Lab](https://minnesotanlp.github.io/). Additionally, I collaborated with [Prof. Jisu Huh](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/jhuh), who leads the Minnesota Computational Advertising Laboratory ([MCAL](https://mcal.umn.edu/)).

#### Research
My academic and research pursuits are centered around the application of large language models in instruction finetuning. My work was recently published as a paper titled "SelectLLM: Can LLMs Select Important Instructions to Annotate?" on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16553), where I contributed as a second author.

I am also deeply involved in developing tools that enhance human-computer interaction and data collection. I developed a Chrome extension that tracks user logs during searches on both traditional and AI-powered search engines. This pioneering tool contributed to a paper submitted to the [AEJMC](https://www.aejmc.org/) conference, titled "Consumer Engagement With AI-Powered Search Engines and Implications for the Future of Search Advertising".

Currently, I am developing a tool aimed at assisting NLP researchers to create customizable text datasets, which can be deployed using Docker, facilitating more streamlined research workflows.

#### Professional Experience
[Piper Sandler](https://www.pipersandler.com/), a prestigious investment bank established in 1895 in Minneapolis, was where I completed my most recent internship. There, I designed a prototype for displaying topic models and sentiment analysis of earnings call transcripts using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and developed Python scraping pipelines with [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) to gather public financial data for the Equity Capital Market group.

Before pursuing my master‚Äôs degree, I worked as a Data Analyst at [Samsung Card](https://www.samsungcard.com/company/english/main/UHPPCI0245M0.jsp) in Seoul, Korea, for over three years. My most significant project involved developing an automated call quality-assurance system using text classification models, which dramatically increased monitoring coverage from 1% to 100% of monthly calls and significantly reduced operational costs.

#### Education and Military Service
I earned my Bachelor of Economics in Statistics from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do) in 2019. During my undergraduate, I served in the Republic of Korea Air Force (January 2014 - January 2016), where I was responsible for managing military vehicle gas logistics.
