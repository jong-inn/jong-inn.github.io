### Hi there! üôå

I'm **Jong Inn Park** **(Î∞ïÏ¢ÖÏù∏)**, known as **Jong**. As a Full-Stack Web Developer in [TNTLAB](https://rlanders.net/researchers/) (Psychology Department, University of Minnesota) led by [Prof. Richard Landers](https://rlanders.net), I build a AI coaching application and integrate Large Language Model (LLM) workflows.

Previously, I was a Research Engineer in the [Minnesota NLP Lab](https://minnesotanlp.github.io/) under [Prof. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/), researching multi-agent application and LLMs cognitive evaluation. I earned my M.S. in [Data Science](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience) from the University of Minnesota in June 2024. During my study, I interned at [Piper Sandler](https://www.pipersandler.com/), prototyping a Streamlit app for topic models and sentiment analysis of earnings call transcripts. Earlier, I spent three and a half years at [Samsung Card](https://www.samsungcard.com/company/english/main/UHPPCI0245M0.jsp) as a Data Analyst, developing NLP-driven call-quality assurance systems.
